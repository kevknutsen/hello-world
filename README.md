===========
Just keeping it real. Love abstract math and view programming as a playground for ideas that must necessarily intersect with reality in order to be shared. What better intersection with reality than through a consistent language of 1's and 0's that describe electric circuits turning on and off in a dazzling pattern of human ingenuity. Peace!
